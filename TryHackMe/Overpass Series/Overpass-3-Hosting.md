# Overpass 3 - Hosting
---

You know them, you love them, your favourite group of broke computer science students
have another business venture! Show them that they probably should hire someone for 
security...

After Overpass's rocky start in infosec, and the commercial failure of their password
manager and subsequent hack, they've decided to try a new business venture.

Overpass has become a web hosting company!\
Unfortunately, they haven't learned from their past mistakes. Rumour has it, their
main web server is extremely vulnerable.
