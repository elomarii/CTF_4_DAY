## The problem

### Description
This encryption algorithm leaks a "bit" of data every time it does a computation. Use this to figure out the encryption key. Download the encryption program here <encrypt.py>. Access the running server with nc saturn.picoctf.net <port>. The flag will be of the format picoCTF{<encryption_key>} where <encryption_key> is 32 lowercase hex characters comprising the 16-byte encryption key being used by the program.

### Hints
1. The "encryption" algorithm is simple and the correlation between the leakage and the key can be very easily modeled.

## Resolution
To encrypt a string `B = b1b2b3...b16` using the key `K = k1k2k3...k16`, each plaintext byte is xored with the corresponding key byte, the result `C = B xor K = c1c2c3...c16` is used as a set of indexes, each one map to an element of `Sbox`, the number of elements that have 1 as the least significant bit is returned.

Now we denote by `Sbox1` (respectively `Sbox0`) the list of indices of elements of `Sbox` whose least significant bit is 1 (respectively 0).\

For a given *i*, if `Sbox[ci]` has a 0 then necessarily `ki xor bi` is in the set `Sbox0`. 

How is this helpful in figuring out K?
If we fix all the bytes of B but one (let it be *bi*) and iterate over all possibilities of that byte, we'll be able to tell for which values of *bi* the encryption *ci* led to an index from which set of indices. For each iteration, we'll end up with a set of acceptable values of *ki*, and by the end, their intersection should lead to a unique index pointing to the element of `Sbox` that is exactly *ki*.
